# Reflection

* Completed the last Module 3 tasks
  * Got help from Ulrich making the webhook task easier than the way we were planning on doing it
* I did not look too much but it seemed like the other teams mostly chose the same tasks as we did
* Created the module 4 contract
  * We have a lot of ideas, but don't know if they are doable
    * Specifically in the timeframe we have and considering that we also have other courses that take up time
* Started also thinking about the final project, but we still want to try some things, see how we like working with the gyroscope for example and how much time and effort every task takes
