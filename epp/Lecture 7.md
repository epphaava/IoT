# Reflection

* to scale up we need some kind of framework
* node-red is good for demoing, however for large-scale projects it is not enough
* open frameworks are good for tinkering, you can imrove stuff and change it etc + don't have to pay for anything before you are sure of wat you want to do
* for professional use paid frameworks might be better as they have support and are (hopefully) constantly improving + it is good to pay the people who are helping you with your business
