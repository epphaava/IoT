# Reflection
* Learned more about MQTT
  * Invented in 1919
  * Has hierarchical topics
    * similar to for example discord, other chatrooms etc
  * Lightweight
* Installed mosquitto and used it to send messages
* Finished the last Module 3 tasks
  * Got some assistance from Ulrich, making the webhook task easier than the way we first wanted to do it
