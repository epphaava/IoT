* IoT has seemingly endless domains
* I got a better understanding of what IoT even is, it's always been a little bit confusing to me.
* The course seems quite lax, with mandatory tasks but freedom to do more of what I like.
* Relaxed class atmosphere, communication between students and instructors.
