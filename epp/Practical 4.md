# Practical 4 Reflection

* Confirmed that Module 2 is done
  *  Had some trouble with proving we have done the work, some missing images and references to code, but managed to fix everything with no problems.
*  Confirmed that Module 3 mandatory tasks are done and there is proof
*  Chose the optional tasks and realized we were quite confused as to where we should start and how to do the tasks
  *  Probably need to take a break and try again with a clearer head
