* Contract based grading is used more in countries like Denmark and Stockholm, I had never heard of it before.
* In addition to making life/work more efficient and helping people with disabilities, IoT can help prevent injuries by monitoring machines, predicting when and why theu might fail.
* Major development of IoT is more difficult than I thought, I knew there were major securit risks, but hoped the technical side was more advanced than it actually is.
* Got help from Ulrich and Steven, and paired up with Karl, who seems cool.
