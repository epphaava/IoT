# Story
**Personalized Automatic Thermostat**

**Residents:**
- Tiit
- Teet
- Katarina

**Scenario:**

Tiit, Teet and Katarina share a two-bedroom house in Tartu, Estonia.

It is -4 degrees outside. Currently, no-one is home. The thermostat is set to a base temperature of 19, based on the price of electricity and the preferences of the residents. The preference of the residents is in the range of 19-26, but electricity is currently quite expensive.

Teet is currently on vacation, so his room is held at a base temperature of 16 degrees in order to conserve energy.

Tiit comes home. Because Tiit’s preferred temperature is 26 degrees, the thermostat increases the temperature in his room and the common spaces to 25 degrees, because it calculates 26 degrees to be too high for the current price of electricity. 

Two hours later Katarina arrives. She prefers a colder climate of 19 degrees, so the thermostat lowers the temperature to 23 degrees in common spaces and 21 degrees in Katarina's room but maintains the 25 degrees in Tiit’s room.

Everyone can modify their preferences in the app and additionally schedule their preferences to change with a calendar-like application. All the temperature changes are monitored and saved to the application, this can be used to see who should pay more and who needs to change their preferences colder to save money. :)
