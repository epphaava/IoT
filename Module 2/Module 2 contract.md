**Agreement:**

As students in this class, we agree to fulfill and present the results of a selection of the following tasks:

- (M) **What is in your kit?**
  - Get one Kit per pair from one of your instructors.
  - Unpack and mark off all parts you find. While doing that also identify what the piece is good for and add potentially the wiring or bus system that it uses as an interface.
  - Create a table in Google Sheets and list all the parts. Link it in the shared pair-part of your portfolio.
  - Google some properties (speed, max length, number of cables needed, voltages, other notable properties) of the respective bus on the respective device - this is important for the next lecture.
  - Fill in the form when you receive the kit. [Form Link](https://forms.gle/BMuoYuQnnsd9DEEK8)

- (O) **Turn the class work into a mini exposé on Low level buses (especially check history, length, speed, wiring):** simple on/off power, analog and one digital pin measuring, RS232, RS 485, I2C, SPI, Onewire.

- (O) **Research, example, purpose/challenge, software support for the main IoT protocols.** Cover at least MQTT and CoAP, but also look at, HTTP Web Request, OSC, BLE or others.

- (M) **Basic electronics prototyping (breadboard, jumper cables)** <- video [Video Link](https://youtu.be/yXirMBP3x4U?si=YiR1OVodxhQ-EjHL)
  - ”Hello breadboard” (leds and button - get power from Wemos D1 Mini plugged into usb power adapter from kit)
  - Create a RGB LED color mixer.

- (M) **Get to know Arduino IDE and the ESP8266 or ESP32.**
  - “Hello world”/Blink in C++ (led, compile for microcontroller with ArduinoIDE)
  - Blink video. [Blink Video Link](https://youtu.be/2nN_ZVyWLzg?si=EkluhBUelc4Rdhbg)
  - Variation(s) of blink with button.
  - Toggle Led with local button.
  - Take pictures and very brief notes for proof and documentation purpose.

**Signature:** Confirm orally in lab with an instructor that you understand the content of this contract and are willing to put in the work for doing and presenting it. By uploading this markdown version to your repository you commit to the selections made in here.
