# Reflection for week 6

* experimented with node-red, didn't understand how to connect the controllers at first but then understood that we still had to upload separate code on these
* got the led blinking according to random generated input
* started working on the M5StickC connection, had some trouble with finding the right libraries
* finally got the gyro and accelerometer values from the sensors printed on the screen and published
* still need to do the node-red integration for the m5 sensor values
