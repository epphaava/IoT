# Lecture 5

* MQTT
  * can scale really easily
  * is lightweight
  * async
  * can simulate for testing (change temperature programatically)


# Reflection 5

* Got an introduction to MQTT. Seems really cool because it's so lightweight.
* Was easy to set up and fun to test :)
* Set up the last week tasks.
* Decided on next MQTT tasks, we probably want to use gyroscopes.
