## Agreement:

As students in this class, we agree to present our skills in using and understanding publish/subscribe with a focus on MQTT, IoT testing (simulators) and integration with MQTT and Node-RED in the following ways:

* Show communication between all computers
* Program to forward (fake?) info
  * produce random info, forward this using MQTT
  * use the received info to turn LED on/off
* Use two gyroscopes, connect to microcontrollers.
* Collect data, print to server
* Use data to produce/influence something - maybe control LED, change color or turn on/off
